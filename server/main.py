    ENDPOINTING: PICK EXACTLY ONE DETECTOR. The two modes below are mutually
    exclusive; running both is the most expensive misconfiguration in this API
    because it truncates transcripts without logging anything on either side.
    See docs/CONFIGURATION.md "Streaming ASR endpointing".

      * Open-mic (server decides). ``?vad_silence_ms=900`` — server VAD
        auto-finalizes on silence, emits a per-segment final, then swaps in a
        fresh ASR stream and keeps the socket open. The client never sends the
        EOS frame. Default silence threshold 400 ms. For clients that are a
        dumb audio pipe (browser demo, live caption).

      * Client-driven (client decides). ``?vad=none`` — no server VAD is
        created; the server finalizes ONLY on the empty b"" frame. For clients
        that already run their own VAD, which usually know things the server
        cannot (wake word just fired, device is playing TTS, session state).

    Running both: the detectors race. When the server wins it starts a NEW
    segment on its side while the client still believes one utterance is in
    progress; from then on the two disagree about which segment is current and
    text goes missing — the head, the tail, or nearly everything, depending on
    whether the client honours, overwrites, or accumulates the server's
    mid-utterance final. Raising ``vad_silence_ms`` does not fix this, it only
    makes the server lose the race more often.

    A VAD-capable client that must stay in open-mic mode has to ACCUMULATE every
    final the server sends — each is a complete segment and the server has
    already moved on. ``{"type":"vad_endpoint"}`` is emitted before the finalize
    compute, so it is also the right signal for flipping client UI state.

    Optional, default-off enrichments applied to the *final* payload only:
    ``?punctuate=true`` inlines punctuation into final.text; ``?speaker_embedding=true``
    adds {speaker_embedding, embedding_model, dim, normalized}. Both default to
    their OVS_PUNCT / OVS_SPEAKER_EMB env values; the query overrides per
    connection (same convention as ?vad=).

    Called from ``v2v_stream`` ONLY when ``OVS_V2V_ENGINE == "voxedge"``,
    AFTER auth + admission (``try_acquire_ws``) + config parse have already
    succeeded. Admission/4429/auth/close-code bookkeeping stays in the caller
    (transport layer); this function only orchestrates the conversation.

    Backends are taken from the SAME already-resolved process singletons the
    legacy path uses — ASR via ``_get_asr_backend()``, TTS via
    ``tts_service.get_backend()``, VAD via ``vad_mod.create_vad(...)`` — so a
    hardware A/B between the two paths is same-backend, same-config.

    Two LLM modes, selected by the ``OVS_V2V_SERVER_LOOP`` env flag:

    * **OFF (default)** — no LLM is wired (``tool_registry=None``, no ``llm``
      backend): production /v2v runs the LLM client-side and re-feeds tokens
      via CLIENT_TEXT, so the engine stays a "client text → TTS" pass-through.
      This is a hard zero-behavior-change contract for the existing path.
    * **ON** (``OVS_V2V_SERVER_LOOP=1``, #37 Phase 2-product) — the server owns
      ASR→LLM(+tools)→TTS: an edge-llm adapter (``server.core.edge_llm_backend``)
      drives the LLM hop and a ``ToolRegistry`` runs the server-side multi-turn
      tool pump (spec §2/§4). Tool schema starts empty (client-advertised tools
      are the next step); the pump path is live so registered tools flow
      without re-wiring.
